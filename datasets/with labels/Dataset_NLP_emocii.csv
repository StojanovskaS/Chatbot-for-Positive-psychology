"Hi - I know this is quite common in the world but I really struggle dealing with my overthinking mind while dating. Once I go on a date and if it goes really well I tend to stress alot to the point that my stomach is pain. My mind goes straight to does he like me does he hate me. What happens if he's not ready? Am I not right for him. I try to do breathing exercises I try alot of things to just have a break from feeling anxious. Like it can last for weeks. I never use to be like this but I've been ghosted once and it just has done a number on me. This is the first time I dated in a while and it kinda reminds me why I don't do it, but I know I have to stick through it. I don't know if I should take this as a sign that I'm not ready or I am ready and it's my anxiety winning."," I know it's really scary - but if you feel comfortable enough with your partner you should go up to them and let them know about how you get really anxious. They can help you with this then by reassuring you they love you/like you and enjoy spending time with you. I know it's really scary to go up to someone and say that and be vulnerable - but if this person really likes you and is the right person for you, they'll do that little task of smiling at you every so often and telling you how you're important to them",Love

I can't seem to choose a university. What can help me bring the right decision?,"It is fundamental to be 120% sure about your subject. You will spend your next three to six years studying it, and then the next 40-50 years working in the area. If you have doubts about your choice, read as many things about it as you can.

In smaller classes you can ask questions and understand the topics more easily.",Love
I can't decide what do I want to study. How can I make a decision?,"Deciding what you would like to study is different from making a decision to do it so you might be better at it if you separate the two and figure out the steps you need. What you want to study depends on your interests and we can have many interests that we want to study in our lifetime. However, choosing one to study as a discipline or career depends on our long term goals. Think about where you would like to be in 3,5 and 10 years. Try to be very specific in terms of work, income, housing,location, family, relationship, friends, etc. Then see which career would get you what you want. It would also help to focus by talking to a career coach.",Curiosity

Is it necessary to feel “chemistry” between us for this to be the right person to marry?,"Chemistry, or feeling like you “click” with another person, is a natural part of a deepening relationship, and a wonderful part of falling in love, but unfortunately, chemistry is sometimes confused with infatuation, which can be fleeting. In the good sense, chemistry means you feel a strong physical and emotional attraction to the other person and want to become closer to him or her. You feel happy in his or her presence and enjoy your time together. This sense of unity and joy at the other’s presence can be a great foundation for a happy marriage.",Love
Doesn’t living together before marriage prevent me from marrying the wrong person and thus getting divorced later on?,"On an intuitive level, it would seem to make sense that couples who had already tried out the proposition of living together, and intimately tested their compatibility, would be able to make a better-informed decision as to whether or not to get hitched, and would thus have a more solid and successful marriage. Yet, almost a dozen studies conducted since the 1970s have shown the very opposite outcome — that cohabitation prior to marriage is linked to lower marital happiness and stability and a higher chance of divorce. This substantial body of research found that couples who lived together before getting married were in fact 33% more likely to split up than those who didn’t. Of course, this isn't a general rule.",Love
How much income should we have between us to marry?,"Many couples, especially younger ones, start their married lives together without a large income, and possibly with debt. This can be a challenge, but it shouldn’t necessarily delay marriage. There’s no magic number when it comes to the income and financial assets a couple should have before marrying, and bride and groom promise to be faithful “for richer” or “for poorer.” At the same time, it’s important to realize that financial hardship can cause conflict in a marriage, and to talk with each other about your plan for meeting your basic needs. Don’t be afraid to seek wise counsel if you’re not sure how you’ll make ends meet.",Love
What can help me choose the right career for me?,"If you’ve assessed your strengths, skills and interests, you should biq have a list of careers to think about. It’s useful to have a long list, with at least ten career choices because there is no such thing as just one dream career. Lots of careers could be a great match for you.",Curiosity
How to know which is the most important thing when picking a career? ,"You probably have multiple lists of occupations in front of you at this point—one generated by each of the self-assessment tools you used. To keep yourself organized, you should combine them into one master list.",Curiosity
How to Make a Career Choice When You Are Undecided?,"First, look for careers that appear on multiple lists and copy them onto a blank page. Title it ""Occupations to Explore."" Your self-assessments ​indicated they are a good fit for you based on several of your traits, so they're definitely worth exploring. Next, find any occupations on your lists that appeal to you. They may be careers you know a bit about and want to explore further. Also, include professions about which you don't know much. You might learn something unexpected.",Curiosity
How can I increase my persistence?,"Before you can develop persistence and eventually achieve success, you need to first identify your wants or desires.

How do you overcome lack of persistence?,,Curiosity

How do I stop being so lazy?,"Setting unrealistic goals and taking on too much can lead to burnout. While not an actual clinical diagnosis, the symptoms of burnout are recognized by medical professionals. Job burnout can cause exhaustion, loss of interest and motivation, and a longing to escape.",Curiosity
How do you know If someone is the right person for you?,"A good sign that someone is right for you is if you can imagine that person fitting in to other parts of your life and not just living in a microcosm of the relationship. Ask yourself: Do they get along with the other people in my life? Do I get along with their friends and family? Do we have mutual interests and things that we enjoy doing together that can be a source of sustainability in a relationship? If the answer is yes, then you may be on the right track",Love

' While three months may be advisable, new research by the dating website eharmony has revealed that one in 10 Brits say it within just a week of dating.",Love
Why is being in love so painful?,"Another reason that love is so painful is because of our body's chemistry. When we fall in love, all sorts of wonderful chemicals are coursing through our bodies. Dopamine, serotine, oxytocin, and endorphins are all stimulated when we are experiencing love and lust",Love
Why can't I love someone who loves me?,"Sometimes the reasons for being unable to love as much we want to stem from things that have nothing to do with the relationship or the other person. Other times, it's all about the relationship — not being with the right person, too many irreconcilable differences or too many problems (arguments, fights, drama etc).",Love
