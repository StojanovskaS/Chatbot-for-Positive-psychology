I can't seem to choose a university. What can help me bring the right decision?,"It is fundamental to be 120% sure about your subject.

In smaller classes you can ask questions and understand the topics more easily.",Love
I can't decide what do I want to study. How can I make a decision?,"Deciding what you would like to study is different from making a decision to do it so you might be better at it if you separate the two and figure out the steps you need. What you want to study depends on your interests and we can have many interests that we want to study in our lifetime. However, choosing one to study as a discipline or career depends on our long term goals. Think about where you would like to be in 3,5 and 10 years.

Is it necessary to feel “chemistry” between us for this to be the right person to marry?,"Chemistry, or feeling like you “click” with another person, is a natural part of a deepening relationship, and a wonderful part of falling in love, but unfortunately, chemistry is sometimes confused with infatuation, which can be fleeting. In the good sense, chemistry means you feel a strong physical and emotional attraction to the other person and want to become closer to him or her. You feel happy in his or her presence and enjoy your time together. This sense of unity and joy at the other’s presence can be a great foundation for a happy marriage.",Love
Doesn’t living together before marriage prevent me from marrying the wrong person and thus getting divorced later on?,"On an intuitive level, it would seem to make sense that couples who had already tried out the proposition of living together, and intimately tested their compatibility, would be able to make a better-informed decision as to whether or not to get hitched, and would thus have a more solid and successful marriage. Yet, almost a dozen studies conducted since the 1970s have shown the very opposite outcome — that cohabitation prior to marriage is linked to lower marital happiness and stability and a higher chance of divorce. This substantial body of research found that couples who lived together before getting married were in fact 33% more likely to split up than those who didn’t. Of course, this isn't a general rule.",Love
How much income should we have between us to marry?,"Many couples, especially younger ones, start their married lives together without a large income, and possibly with debt. This can be a challenge, but it shouldn’t necessarily delay marriage. There’s no magic number when it comes to the income and financial assets a couple should have before marrying, and bride and groom promise to be faithful “for richer” or “for poorer.” At the same time, it’s important to realize that financial hardship can cause conflict in a marriage, and to talk with each other about your plan for meeting your basic needs. Don’t be afraid to seek wise counsel if you’re not sure how you’ll make ends meet.",Love
What can help me choose the right career for me?,"If you’ve assessed your strengths, skills and interests, you should biq have a list of careers to think about.

How do you know If someone is the right person for you?,"A good sign that someone is right for you is if you can imagine that person fitting in to other parts of your life and not just living in a microcosm of the relationship.

Why can't I love someone who loves me?,"Sometimes the reasons for being unable to love as much we want to stem from things that have nothing to do with the relationship or the other person.

Do children experience grief?,"Yes, if children are old enough to love, they are old enough to grieve. Many times in our society children are the forgotten grievers. For instance, when a parent dies, whom do we expect to help the child with their grief? The surviving parent. That parent not only has their own grief to deal with but they are learning for the first time how to be a single parent. They, like their child, can use support in their grieving. Children don’t grieve the way we do. They don’t openly talk about how they are feeling. A death in their life usually causes them to feel even more different than usual. Kids feel different enough – a death causes them to feel even more different and isolated. Bereavement groups are extremely helpful for children since they are with other children who have experienced a loss also.",Curiosity
I have a friend in grief. How can I help?,"One of the mistakes we make is asking people in deep grief how we can help them. They are often too lost in their own sorrow to identify needs. It’s OK to ask; but just know you can step in and help. For instance, if it’s after the funeral at a reception and the trash needs to be taken out – don’t ask, just help. In the old days we would gather around the loved one and just do things for them. Bring over some food so that they don’t have to cook but can still eat well. You probably know their life – offer to pick up the kids, help them with their yard, offer to take them on errands.",Grief
What are the five stages of grief?,"The five stages, denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance are a part of the framework that makes up our learning to live with the one we lost. They are tools to help us frame and identify what we may be feeling. But they are not stops on some linear timeline in grief. Not everyone goes through all of them or in a prescribed order.The stages have evolved since their introduction and they have been very misunderstood over the past three decades. They were never meant to help tuck messy emotions into neat packages. They are responses to loss that many people have, but there is not a typical response to loss as there is no typical loss.

How long does grief last? Will I ever get over the lost of a loved one?,"Grief is the healing process that helps us deal with the loss of a loved-one.

A well-known person has died and I feel sad. Why do I feel this way?,"Many times when a well-known person dies, we collectively feel it as a society. You may have not known them personally; however, you may have grown up with them as your President or saw their face every week on TV, or just experienced them as always being part of your world. And when your world experiences a loss you experience a loss. Sometimes people are surprised at the sadness because of the intensity of the sadness they feel. It becomes multiplied when all those around you are feeling sad as well. Even if you didn’t know the person, honor that grief. Take time to watch their funeral on TV. Talk to friends and family about them. Light a candle in their honor. You may have not known them; but the loss can still feel personal to you.",Grief

You have to be open and tell them everything, including that you have thought about suicide.",Grief
It is has been years since my loved one's death. Why don't I feel better?,"Unlike a physical injury, there isn't an anticipated or typical rate of healing for grief. Healing often takes place in small increments. When you look at your life post-loss, are there times when you did feel a little better? Are there moments when you laugh? Are there times—however brief—when you are able to focus on something other than the loss? When you look back at these smaller moments over time, you will notice that you are making progress. Grief can be complex. There are often many layers to work through. Your most recent grief may be connected to a past loss and you may not realize that you are actually attempting to process more than one. It also helps to practice self- compassion with yourself. Being critical with yourself hurts more than you may realize.",Grief
"My counselor seemed to help in the beginning but now it feels like a waste of time. I still feel like I'm down, so should I quit therapy?","Your therapist may have helped you with some initial crisis management, so you noticed what you think of as ""results."" Now that the crisis is resolved, you are coping with the feelings associated with grief. These feeling will dissolve in a few therapy sessions. Be honest with your therapist and tell him or her that you don't feel like you are getting anything out of your sessions.",Grief
"My best friend, who was there for me before my beloved died, no longer talks to me or avoids me. Why can't my friend support me?","Death changes you, so you are no longer the person you were before your loss. Your friend may not be able to relate you now. This is unfortunate because it is another loss for you. You can have a heart-to-heart conversation and ask your friend if there is something that you did to create this distance. You can also tell your friend that you need his or her extra support. But remember that some people are not comfortable with the very topic of grief. They don't know what to say or are afraid of saying the wrong thing, so they avoid anything associated with loss—and your very presence is a reminder of loss.",Grief
I made mistakes that are linked to my grief. I wasn't in my right mind. How do I take corrective action?,"Everyone I meet who is dealing with loss says they made some type of mistake—something they said in a private conversation or an action they now regret. This might be with someone they love or in a professional environment. You need to own the mistake and ask if there is some way that you can repair the damage. How you handle yourself in this conversation will set the tone for the future. Accept responsibility; if someone chooses not to overlook your mistake or refuses to engage with you, simply detach yourself: You can't make them forgive you.",Grief
Do all people grieve alike?,"No, there is no prescribed way to grieve. Many cry and some do not. Many feel very sad and want to talk about it. Others want to deal with it more on their own. Most people report that their grief comes and goes unpredictably, almost like a roller coaster. But not everyone reports that. Some people feel worse early on, while others find that their most difficult times come months or sometimes even years afterwards.",Grief
Is it normal to feel like you're going crazy during grief?,"That's one of the most normal feelings of all. A time of grief is an unusual time, even a ""crazy"" time, in one's life. In a crazy period it can make perfect sense to act a little crazy oneself. Many people, perhaps the majority, wonder if this is happening to them at one time or another in their grieving process. The best thing to do is to remember that one is in good company with many others. ""The crazies"" will pass.",Grief
What helps with the grieving process?,"Above all else, what usually helps the most is being able to talk with at least one person about one's feelings -- all the ups and downs, the sadness and the fear, the memories and the hopes. Sometimes bereaved people want to talk with several different people about what is happening with them. Others find value in joining a grief support group. However one chooses, one needs to get one's feelings off one's chest. There are ways of doing that other than talking, of course. Writing can be quite valuable -- keeping a journal of one's thoughts and feelings, or writing letters to the Loved One who has died, or composing stories of one's memories, or creating poetry. Some people prefer to express their grief in other ways -- for example, through painting or sculpture, or by sewing or woodworking. Some find meaning in working on a project -- creating a memorial, or starting a project that will help others. One small thing that almost always helps is being able to spend time in nature, and to do so at least once a day. Looking at the created world around you and being in touch with the natural rhythms of life and death can be both healing and restorative.",Grief
"I’m not ready to give in to sex, but my boyfriend tells me that sexual intercourse would make the affection we have for each other grow stronger. Is this true?","Having sexual intercourse alone does not make a good relationship. You can love someone without going to bed with him. You don’t prove your love with sex. Sexual intercourse can be wonderful in a loving relationship. But if one person doesn’t want it, it is not an act of love to force that person to have it. If you do not want to have sexual relationship with your boyfriend, don’t. He must respect your decision. If he can’t, then he doesn’t love you like he claims. Speak to your boyfriend again about your feelings. If he would not listen, you may need to reconsider your staying in that relationship.",Love
How do you know if it’s really love that you feel for a person?,"This is a difficult question because there aren’t clear cut definitions of what love is. Many young people often “fall in love” once they begin dating. However it is important to recognize the differences between infatuation and true love. Infatuation is an intense, exciting kind of feeling. People sometimes mistake infatuation for love, but infatuation usually doesn’t last very long, while true love does.",Love
What counts as a relationship?,"There are lots of different types of relationship, from casual sex to marriage. People from some backgrounds often get married to someone they’ve only met a few times, and then begin the process of getting to know them and loving them through time. In other contexts, people try relationships out with different people, and it can take a while for them to find out what they want and what works. All relationships are different, but they usually all have one thing in common – when you’re in a relationship with someone it usually means that you both like each other (and fancy each other!) more than anyone else.

Is it okay that my partner needs space?,"As long as they talk about it first — and don’t just ignore you or leave you hanging — it’s more than OK to go with your partner’s request to spend time apart, relax separately, not text for a few hours, etc. “Providing your partner with space shows them that you respect their boundaries and allows them to feel safe in the relationship,” Amladi says.

If your partner is someone who always tends to turn inward instead of reaching out for support, then it’ll be even more necessary to have this conversation. “If it bothers you, say so,” Amladi says. “But also let your partner explain how they feel, so you both can come to an understanding as to what they need space for, is so important.”

And remember, giving each other space is actually healthy, whether it’s due to stress or not. “Your partner needs to take care of themselves, just as you need to take care of yourself,” Prescott says. “Sometimes this is done as a pair, other times it has to be done [alone]. Remember that you are allowed to ask for space when you need it, too.”",Love
How do you measure happiness? And how do we know if we're happy enough?,"Although we can't measure happiness with great precision, we can measure it well enough to do scientific studies that teach us a lot. The common claim that you can't measure a feeling is just plain wrong. You do it every time you ask your partner ""How do you like it when I do this?"" Scientists have slightly more sophisticated techniques, of course, but the essence of the enterprise is the same. People generally know how happy they are at the moment they are asked, and if you ask them, they will usually tell you. If you can quantify their answers (and we can), you can investigate happiness scientifically (and we do).
