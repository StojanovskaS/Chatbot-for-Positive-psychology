"Hi - I know this is quite common in the world but I really struggle dealing with my overthinking mind while dating. Once I go on a date and if it goes really well I tend to stress alot to the point that my stomach is pain. My mind goes straight to does he like me does he hate me. What happens if he's not ready? Am I not right for him. I try to do breathing exercises I try alot of things to just have a break from feeling anxious. Like it can last for weeks. I never use to be like this but I've been ghosted once and it just has done a number on me. This is the first time I dated in a while and it kinda reminds me why I don't do it, but I know I have to stick through it. I don't know if I should take this as a sign that I'm not ready or I am ready and it's my anxiety winning."," I know it's really scary - but if you feel comfortable enough with your partner you should go up to them and let them know about how you get really anxious. They can help you with this then by reassuring you they love you/like you and enjoy spending time with you. I know it's really scary to go up to someone and say that and be vulnerable - but if this person really likes you and is the right person for you, they'll do that little task of smiling at you every so often and telling you how you're important to them"
